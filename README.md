> A lightweight, efficient implementation of John Conway's famous cellular automaton, written in C.

## 🧬 About The Project

This project simulates **Conway's Game of Life**, a zero-player game that mimics the evolution of life based on a simple set of deterministic rules.

I developed this simulation to explore:
* **Cellular Automata:** How complex biological patterns emerge from simple rules.
* **C Programming:** Efficient memory usage and logic implementation.
* **Algorithmic Logic:** Iterating through grid generations and neighbor checking.

It currently supports standard patterns (like Gliders and Oscillators) running directly in the terminal console.

    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd Game_of_life
    ```

3.  **Compile the code**
    ```bash
    gcc Game_of_life.c -o game
    ```

## 🕹️ Usage

Run the compiled executable from your terminal:
